        <p>Born in the year 1999, Philip Protheroe quickly found a passion in writing in the third person. Due to being born a baby, sadly he couldn't read or write, but that didn't stop him! He became a prolific writer and reader before he could walk, scoffing at the likes of Dickens and Hemmingway and preferring to read the much more acclaimed Seuss and Dahl. A six time Nobel Peace Prize winner, Philip is not. However, he is still pretty nice.</p>
